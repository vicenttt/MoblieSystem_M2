# MoblieSystem_M2

- Project Background
To design the UI/UX design for the indoor location service system. The UI/UX was designed to attract users and improve the usability of the system.

- Installation
This project is supposed to generate apk format, which can be run directly in Android Studio. However, there were many debugging issues with the code exported through Figma's plugin. So the operation can only be done in Figma's virtualizer.

- Using
Run apk file directly (original plan). There are 10 different pages in this system. Each page can be reached via Home Page or connected to the specified page via Home Page and then reach the different pages.

- Main project leader
Vicenttt

- Contribution method
Vicenttt did the entire UI/UX design independently through Figma, and the apk file generation failed due to his experience and skills.



  1. Copy all files and folders in your "Page 1" 
     export directory (this folder).

  2. Locate your Android Studio Projects folder.  

     Default Locations
     -----------------
     WIN: %userprofile%\StudioProjects
     MAC: ~\StudioProjects

  3. Create a new Android Studio Project with the name 
     "Page 1" and ensure you are using 
     "Add no Activity" during the Activity Settings.

  4. Paste and *replace all* files and folders located in 
     your project folder { Page 1/app/src/main } with 
     the contents copied in Step 1.

  5. Done!
